# Policy Engine Documentation

## Overview

The GhostMesh Policy Engine implements security policy enforcement and audit logging for industrial IoT environments. It processes alerts and control commands to enforce security actions like isolation, throttling, and unblocking of assets, while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail.

## Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL

**Linear Issue:** THE-63  
**Implementation Date:** September 13, 2025  
**Service Name:** `policy`  
**Container:** `ghostmesh-policy`

## Core Features

### Policy Enforcement
- **Alert Processing:** Subscribes to `alerts/#` topics for real-time security monitoring
- **Control Commands:** Processes `control/#` topics for manual operator actions
- **Auto-Policy:** High severity alerts trigger automatic isolation
- **State Tracking:** Maintains blocked and throttled asset states

### Security Actions
- **Isolate:** Block all traffic for an asset (complete isolation)
- **Throttle:** Limit traffic rate for an asset (rate limiting)
- **Unblock:** Restore normal traffic for an asset (remove restrictions)

### Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Trail:** All actions logged with unique identifiers
- **MQTT Publishing:** Audit events published to `audit/actions` topic
- **Local Storage:** Maintains audit log for performance and debugging
- **Schema Compliance:** Follows GhostMesh architecture audit schema

## MQTT Integration

### Input Topics
- **Alert Subscription:** `alerts/#` - Receives anomaly detection alerts
- **Control Subscription:** `control/#` - Receives operator control commands

### Output Topics
- **Audit Publishing:** `audit/actions` - Publishes audit events for all actions
- **Retention:** Retained messages for audit persistence
- **QoS Level:** 1 (at least once delivery)

## Policy Actions

### Isolate Action
**Purpose:** Complete isolation of an asset from all network traffic
**Implementation:**
- Adds asset to `blocked_assets` set
- Removes from `throttled_assets` if present
- Simulates nftables rules and MQTT broker ACL updates
- Logs isolation action with timestamp

**Trigger Conditions:**
- High severity alerts (automatic)
- Manual control commands
- Operator-initiated isolation

### Throttle Action
**Purpose:** Rate limiting for an asset to reduce traffic volume
**Implementation:**
- Adds asset to `throttled_assets` set
- Removes from `blocked_assets` if present
- Simulates tc (traffic control) rules
- Applies bandwidth restrictions

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Medium severity alerts (configurable)
- Manual control commands
- Operator-initiated throttling

### Unblock Action
**Purpose:** Restore normal traffic for a previously restricted asset
**Implementation:**
- Removes asset from both `blocked_assets` and `throttled_assets`
- Restores normal network policies
- Clears all restrictions

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Manual control commands only
- Operator-initiated unblocking
- Recovery procedures

## Audit Schema

The policy engine publishes audit events following the GhostMesh architecture schema:

```json
{
  "actionId": "act-{uuid}",
  "assetId": "press01",
  "action": "isolate",
  "method": "app_layer_blocking",
  "result": "success",
  "ts": "2025-09-13T11:37:24.358643+00:00",
  "details": "Action isolate executed for press01"
}
```

### Field Descriptions
- **actionId:** Unique identifier with "act-" prefix and 8-character UUID
- **assetId:** Asset identifier from the action
- **action:** Action type (isolate, throttle, unblock)
- **method:** Implementation method (app_layer_blocking)
- **result:** Execution result (success, failed, validation_error)
- **ts:** ISO 8601 timestamp of action execution
- **details:** Additional information about the action (optional)

## Control Command Schema

The policy engine processes control commands following this schema:

```json
{
  "assetId": "press01",
  "command": "isolate",
  "reason": "operator_action",
  "refAlertId": "a-9f1c3",
  "ts": "2025-09-13T11:37:00.000Z"
}
```

### Field Descriptions
- **assetId:** Target asset identifier
- **command:** Command to execute (isolate, throttle, unblock)
- **reason:** Reason for the command (operator_action, auto_policy, etc.)
- **refAlertId:** Reference to triggering alert (optional)
- **ts:** ISO 8601 timestamp of command

## Auto-Policy Features

### High Severity Auto-Isolation
- **Trigger:** High severity alerts (severity = "high")
- **Action:** Automatic isolation of the affected asset
- **Audit:** Full audit trail with auto_policy reason
- **Recovery:** Manual unblock required

### Command Validation
- **Supported Commands:** isolate, throttle, unblock
- **Validation:** Rejects unsupported commands
- **Error Handling:** Publishes validation_error audit events
- **Logging:** Comprehensive error logging

## State Management

### Asset State Tracking
```python
# Blocked assets (complete isolation)
blocked_assets: Set[str] = {"press01", "conveyor02"}

# Throttled assets (rate limited)
throttled_assets: Set[str] = {"press03"}

# Audit log (last 1000 events)
audit_log: List[Dict] = [...]
```

### State Persistence
- **Memory Storage:** In-memory state tracking for performance
- **Audit Persistence:** MQTT retained messages for audit events
- **Recovery:** State rebuilt from audit events on restart
- **Limits:** Maximum 1000 audit events in memory

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "audit/actions" -C 10

# Subscribe to control commands
podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "control/+/+" -C 10

# Subscribe to alerts
podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "alerts/+/+" -C 10
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Start Services:** `make start`
2. **Verify Connection:** Check logs for "Connected to MQTT broker"
3. **Send Control Command:** Publish to `control/<asset>/<command>`
4. **Monitor Audit Events:** Subscribe to `audit/actions`
5. **Verify State:** Check blocked/throttled asset states

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test isolate command
podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "control/press01/isolate" \
  -m '{"assetId": "press01", "command": "isolate", "reason": "test", "ts": "2025-09-13T11:37:00.000Z"}' \
  -u iot -P iotpass

# Test unblock command
podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "control/press01/unblock" \
  -m '{"assetId": "press01", "command": "unblock", "reason": "test", "ts": "2025-09-13T11:37:00.000Z"}' \
  -u iot -P iotpass

# Test throttle command
podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "control/press01/throttle" \
  -m '{"assetId": "press01", "command": "throttle", "reason": "test", "ts": "2025-09-13T11:37:00.000Z"}' \
  -u iot -P iotpass
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command Not Executed**
- **Cause:** Invalid command or malformed JSON
- **Solution:** Check command format and JSON schema
- **Debug:** Check logs for validation errors

**No Audit Events**
- **Cause:** MQTT publishing failure or connection issues
- **Solution:** Verify MQTT connection and broker status
- **Debug:** Check MQTT logs and network connectivity

**State Not Persisted**
- **Cause:** Service restart or memory issues
- **Solution:** Check audit events for state reconstruction
- **Debug:** Monitor audit log size and memory usage

**Auto-Policy Not Triggering**
- **Cause:** Alert severity not high or MQTT subscription issues
- **Solution:** Verify alert format and severity levels
- **Debug:** Check alert subscription and processing logs

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in `policy_engine.py`:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **MQTT Authentication:** Currently using iot user (temporary)
- **Command Validation:** Strict validation of control commands
- **Audit Trail:** Comprehensive logging for security compliance

### Network Security
- **Container Isolation:** Runs in isolated container network
- **MQTT Security:** Relies on MQTT broker authentication
- **State Protection:** In-memory state with audit persistence

### Operational Security
- **Auto-Policy:** Automatic isolation for high severity alerts
- **Manual Override:** Operator can override automatic actions
- **Recovery Procedures:** Clear unblock procedures for recovery

## Future Enhancements
