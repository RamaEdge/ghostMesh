# GhostMesh â€” Edge AI Security Copilot

GhostMesh is an edge-resident security copilot for industrial/IoT environments that detects anomalies in real-time, explains risks in plain language, and enforces policy actions.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd ghostmesh
make quick-start
open http://<pi-ip>:8501   # Streamlit dashboard
```
