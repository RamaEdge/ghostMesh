# GhostMesh â€” Edge AI Security Copilot

GhostMesh is an edge-resident security copilot for industrial/IoT environments that detects anomalies in real-time, explains risks in plain language, and enforces policy actions.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (3 Commands)

### Prerequisites
- **Podman** (recommended) or Docker installed
- **Podman Compose** or Docker Compose
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (8GB RAM) or compatible system
- **8GB RAM minimum** (16GB recommended for LLM)
- **1TB SSD** for model storage

### 3-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamaEdge/ghostMesh.git && cd ghostMesh
make quick-start
make test          # Verify everything is working
```

### Alternative: Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/RamaEdge/ghostMesh.git
cd ghostMesh
make setup

# 2. Start services
make start

# 3. Verify installation
make test
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check service status
make status

# View live telemetry data
timeout 10s podman exec ghostmesh-mosquitto mosquitto_sub -h localhost -u gateway -P gatewaypass -t "factory/+/+/+" -C 5 -W 5

# View service logs
make logs
```

### Available Commands

```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make setup         # Initial project setup
make start         # Start all services (production)
make stop          # Stop all services
make test          # Run comprehensive tests
make logs          # Show service logs
make status        # Check service status
make build         # Build all containers
make clean         # Clean up containers and images
make dev           # Start development environment
make prod          # Start production environment
make quick-start   # Setup and start all services
make quick-test    # Start services and run tests
```

### Deployment Profiles

**Development Mode:**
```bash
make dev           # Start with debug logging and hot reload
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
make prod          # Start with optimized settings and monitoring
```

**Manual Profile Selection:**
```bash
# Development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
