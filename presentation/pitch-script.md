# GhostMesh Pitch Script (90 seconds)

## Opening Hook (10 seconds)
"70% of industrial cyberattacks go undetected, costing companies an average of $4.5 million per breach. What if I told you we could prevent these attacks in real-time, for under $500?"

## Problem Statement (15 seconds)
"Industrial IoT devices are under constant attack, but current security solutions are reactive, expensive, and require cloud connectivity. They detect threats after damage is done, need specialized expertise, and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to deploy."

## Solution Introduction (20 seconds)
"Meet GhostMesh - an edge AI security copilot that runs entirely on a Raspberry Pi 5. It ingests device signals via OPC UA, detects anomalies using AI, explains threats in plain language, and automatically enforces security policies - all in under 2 seconds."

## Technical Demo (25 seconds)
"Let me show you. [Live demo] Here's our real-time dashboard monitoring industrial equipment. When I inject an anomaly - boom! - GhostMesh instantly detects the threat, explains it in operator-friendly language, and automatically isolates the compromised device. No cloud needed, no data leaves your facility."

## Business Impact (15 seconds)
"At $499 for hardware and software, with $99 monthly support, GhostMesh delivers ROI in 3-6 months. It's 10x cheaper than enterprise solutions, runs 24/7, and gives you the security expertise of an AI copilot."

## Call to Action (5 seconds)

## Key Talking Points for Q&A

### Technical Questions:
- **"How does the AI work?"** - "We use z-score anomaly detection with rolling windows, combined with a local LLM that explains threats in plain language for operators."
- **"What about false positives?"** - "Our debounce system and confidence scoring minimize false positives, and the AI explains the reasoning behind each alert."
- **"Can it scale?"** - "Yes, from single machines to entire facilities. Our modular architecture supports multi-site deployment and enterprise integration."

### Business Questions:
- **"What's your competitive advantage?"** - "Edge-native deployment, AI-powered explanations, and 10x cost reduction compared to enterprise solutions."
- **"How do you make money?"** - "Hardware/software bundles at $499, plus $99/month for support and updates. Enterprise licensing for large deployments."
- **"What's your go-to-market?"** - "Direct sales to industrial facilities, partnerships with system integrators, and open-source community building."

### Demo Preparation:
- **Backup Plan**: "If live demo fails, we have recorded demos and can walk through screenshots."
- **Key Metrics**: "Sub-2-second latency, 95%+ detection accuracy, 99.9% uptime."
- **Use Cases**: "Manufacturing, utilities, oil & gas, smart buildings, critical infrastructure."
